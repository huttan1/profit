Each skin for Litium Studio have its own folder and is read during startup. 

The folder name is used as a name for the skin in control panel where user selects skin. 

The stylesheet file should be named Skin.css. The easiest way to create a new skin
is to take a copy of the LitiumStudio\StyleSheets\DefaultSkin\Skin.css file and place
in your own skin folder.
